# Kickstarter_Challenge with Excel

### Analysising Data to compare launch dates and their funding goals for plays. In our first delverable I made a pivot table with outcomes based on their launch date. In our second delverable I broke down outcomes based on goals using a spreadsheet.

## Analysis Challenges

## Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### The two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes on Launch date are the most successful and failed plays were in the month of May. Then in the month of December the successful plays hit a all-time with failed plays doing the same. So, around May and June would be the best time to try to produce a play. In December would be the worst time to try to produce a play. Here’s a line chart to back my data.

## Theater Outcomes Based on Goals
#### Based on their Goals the most successful plays had a goal less than five thousand based on the total number of projects. The biggest failed rates were at some of the highest goals. I made a line chart to represent this data and show the trend.

#### In conclusion you can see the best time to start a play is around the month of May with a funding goal less than 5000 to be the most successful. Some of the limitations of these datasets are they don’t show any info correlating to the types of plays. We could also have used a bar chart to show are findings.
